People often struggle to be their authentic selves around others due to a complex interplay of psychological, social, and environmental factors. These reasons largely stem from a fundamental human need for social acceptance and belonging, which can override the desire for individual expression. 
Here is a list of 50 reasons why a person may not be their authentic self around other people:
Fear of Judgment and Rejection 
Fear of being judged: The primary motivation for hiding true identity is often the fear of negative evaluation by others.
Fear of rejection/ostracism: Humans have an innate, evolutionary drive to belong to a group, and the threat of being excluded is a powerful deterrent to authenticity.
Fear of criticism: Past experiences with harsh criticism can make individuals wary of expressing their true opinions or showing their vulnerabilities.
Fear of being disliked: The belief that their true personality is unlikable or unappealing.
Fear of humiliation/embarrassment: A concern about doing or saying something that might lead to public shame.
Fear of being "canceled": In the modern digital world, people may fear widespread social attacks or even job loss for expressing an unpopular opinion.
Fear of vulnerability: The apprehension of opening up and sharing inner feelings, which can feel risky.
Fear of conflict: Avoiding disagreements or confrontation by conforming to others' opinions or preferences.
Fear of losing social support: The high stakes of potentially losing friends, family, or professional connections.
Fear of being misunderstood: The belief that others will not understand their actions, thoughts, or intentions. 
Self-Perception and Insecurity
Low self-esteem/self-worth: A deep-seated belief that one is not "good enough" as they are.
Lack of self-knowledge: Not being sure of one's own identity, values, and feelings, making it hard to express them authentically.
Insecurity: General feelings of inadequacy or a lack of confidence in one's own traits.
Unresolved trauma: Past experiences (e.g., bullying, abuse, neglect) can lead to self-loathing, shame, and a pattern of hiding the true self for safety.
Shame and guilt: Feeling ashamed of personal flaws, secrets, or past mistakes, and hiding them to save face.
Perfectionism: The pursuit of an elusive "perfect self" based on perceived societal standards, leading to a constant performance.
Negative self-beliefs: Internalized criticism and an inner critic that berates the person.
Comparing oneself to others: Constantly measuring one's life or personality against those of peers or people on social media.
Feeling unworthy: A sense that one's needs, opinions, or even existence are not deserving of attention or respect.
Emotional suppression: Learning to hide or disconnect from one's genuine emotions, often as a childhood survival strategy. 
Social and Environmental Pressures
Need for belonging: A basic human instinct to fit in and be part of a community.
Social norms and conformity: The unwritten rules of society or a specific group that dictate expected behaviors, attitudes, and dress.
Peer pressure: Direct or subtle influence from peers to conform to their expectations or behaviors.
Societal expectations: Broad cultural or gender-based pressures to act in a certain "appropriate" way (e.g., "be quieter," "be softer").
"Code-switching": The necessity of changing behavior, speech, and appearance to navigate different social environments (e.g., corporate America vs. home).
Desire for external validation: Relying on others for approval rather than developing internal self-judgment.
Mirroring others: Subconsciously mimicking the behavior, interests, or personality traits of the people around them to fit in.
Pressure to appear successful/flawless: Curating an image of a perfect life, especially prevalent with the influence of social media.
Protecting privacy/secrets: Hiding specific information about one's life, family background, or past to avoid exposure.
Group dynamics: People act differently depending on the specific environment or group they are with. 
Psychological Conditions & Learned Behaviors
Social anxiety disorder: A diagnosable condition involving intense fear of social situations where one might be scrutinized or judged.
Anxiety/Depression: Mental health conditions that can profoundly impact self-perception and interaction with others.
Avoidant attachment style: Learning in childhood that expressing emotions leads to being ignored or punished, resulting in a tendency to hide feelings as an adult.
People-pleasing (fawn response): A trauma response that involves constantly trying to appease others to avoid conflict or ensure safety.
Lack of social skills: Feeling unsure of how to behave or what to say in social situations, leading to withdrawal or mimicking others.
Performance anxiety: The fear related to being "on show" or performing in public.
Internalized oppression/stigma: Hiding aspects of identity (e.g., sexual orientation, mental illness, race) due to societal stigma.
Dissociation: A disconnect from one's own feelings, thoughts, or behaviors.
Inability to control emotions: Hiding true feelings to avoid displaying perceived weakness or an "uncontrolled" temper.
Past negative experiences (bullying): Experiences where vulnerabilities were used as "ammunition" by others, leading to a guarded personality. 
Other Reasons
Uncertainty in new situations: Lacking knowledge on how to behave, people look to others for guidance (informational conformity).
Desire for professional advancement: The need to conform to a specific "corporate" persona to succeed in a job.
Lack of role models for authenticity: Not having seen adults around them express their true selves in a healthy manner.
Fear of change: Hiding keeps life comfortable and predictable, while authenticity might require difficult changes.
Protecting the feelings of others: Hiding opinions or feelings to avoid upsetting friends or family.
Not wanting to stand out: Preferring a neutral stance to avoid the spotlight or attention.
Belief alignment: Adjusting personal values to match those of a desired group to reinforce a sense of connection.
External influences (media): Consuming media that promotes "perfect" or specific lifestyles, leading people to copy those personalities.
Being overly guarded/secretive: A general habit of being closed off due to past experiences with untrustworthy people.
Loss of individuality: Conforming so much over time that one loses track of their original, authentic self, a process called "masking".
