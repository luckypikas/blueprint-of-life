THE MENTOR’S BLUEPRINT OF LIFE
A How-To Guide for Elders, Writers, Creators, and Builders of Wisdom

INTRODUCTION: WHAT THIS PROJECT REALLY IS
The Blueprint of Life and Stages of Life series exist for one reason:
To prevent people from wasting decades learning lessons the hard way—when someone else has already paid the price.
This is not a motivational book.
It is not a theory book.
It is not a self-help trend.
It is a wisdom transfer system.
It captures lived experience, decisions, mistakes, recoveries, realizations, systems, and survival knowledge—then passes it forward in language the next generation can actually understand.
This guide shows you how to contribute, remix, expand, or reinterpret that knowledge—without breaking the spirit of the project.

PART I — WHAT THE BLUEPRINT OF LIFE SERIES IS ABOUT (REFRESH)
At its core, the Blueprint of Life documents:
Stages of life people don’t prepare for
Decisions that quietly change trajectories
Systems people wish they understood earlier
Consequences nobody warned them about
Rules people had to learn by pain, not permission
It is about:
timing
tradeoffs
leverage
recovery
restraint
courage
and long-term thinking
The Stages of Life series zooms out further and asks:
What changes at 18, 25, 35, 50?
What stops working?
What starts mattering more?
What mistakes repeat across generations?
Your role as a contributor is not to be perfect.
Your role is to be honest, specific, and useful.

PART II — HOW ELDERS, WRITERS & CREATORS CAN REWRITE OR EXPAND IT
You are not rewriting the Blueprint.
You are writing your Blueprint.
That is why remixed works must carry this title format:
THE MENTOR’S BLUEPRINT OF LIFE — According to (Your Name or Avatar)
You may:
rewrite sections in your own voice
add new chapters or stages
challenge existing assumptions
add cultural, economic, or generational nuance
modernize language
add stories, failures, and reversals
You may not:
remove the core premise
reduce it to motivational fluff
strip context or consequence
contribute less than the minimum threshold

PART III — CONTRIBUTION RULES (CLEAR & SIMPLE)
Minimum Contribution Requirement
To remix or publish under your name, you must contribute at least 20% of original material or a minimum word count set by Lucky Pikas (recommended: 3,000–5,000 words).
This ensures:
integrity
effort
respect for the project
Title Rule
You must include:
The Mentor’s Blueprint of Life — According to (Name)
Subtitles may change. The core title may not.

PART IV — WHAT TO WRITE ABOUT (PROMPTS & METRICS)
Below are starter metrics. You do not need to use all of them.
25 CORE LIFE METRICS TO WRITE FROM
First real failure
Money mistakes
Bad advice you followed
Good advice you ignored
Choosing the wrong people
Staying too long
Leaving too early
Health warnings you dismissed
Authority you misunderstood
Fear disguised as logic
Discipline you delayed
Skills that saved you
Skills you wish you learned sooner
Regret vs responsibility
Impulse vs intention
Loneliness vs isolation
Reputation damage
Second chances
When pride cost you
When humility paid you
Systems that quietly work
Systems that quietly fail
What success actually costs
What peace actually requires
What never mattered as much as you thought
There are more. These are anchors—not limits.

PART V — LEADING QUESTIONS TO UNLOCK MEMORY & WISDOM
Use these to pull truth out of yourself:
What decision quietly changed everything?
What problem kept repeating until you changed?
What did nobody warn you about?
What did you learn too late?
What advice would you give your younger self without softening it?
What mistake did confidence cause?
What mistake did fear cause?
What truth did time force you to accept?
What did you survive that others didn’t?
What systems saved you from chaos?

PART VI — TRIGGERING & OPENING STATEMENTS (USE RESPONSIBLY)
These are designed to unlock honesty—not manipulation.
“Nobody prepared me for this part.”
“This mistake cost me years.”
“I thought I had time. I didn’t.”
“I ignored the signs because I wanted comfort.”
“Here’s what I wish someone told me plainly.”
“This is where most people lie to themselves.”
“This lesson only comes with consequences.”
“I learned this after losing something.”
“This is not popular advice, but it’s real.”
“If I could erase one illusion, it would be this.”
